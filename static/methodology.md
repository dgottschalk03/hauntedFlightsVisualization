### ‚úàÔ∏è **Airport Radius of Influence**

I filtered out closed airports and determined the radii of influence for the following categories using the [FAA Airspace Guidelines](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/17_phak_ch15.pdf):

| **Airport Type**                 | **Class** | **Radius of Influence** | **Notes**                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **small_airports**               | Class D   | 3 Nautical Miles        | Any airport with a control tower.                                                                         |
| **medium_airport**               | Class C   | 5 Nautical Miles        | "Airports of Moderate Importance."                                                                        |
| **large_airport**                | Class B   | 30 Nautical Miles       | Large commercial airports.                                                                                |
| **heliports**                    | N/A       | 1.5 Nautical Miles      | [Heliport Guidelines](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_150_5390_2D_Heliports.pdf) (Figure 7-1) specify a minimum airspace of 4,000 ft. We assumed areas within 3 miles are within the zone of influence. |
| **balloonports, seaplane_bases** | N/A       | 3 Nautical Miles        | Assumed similar to small airports (total cop out I know).                                                                        |

### üõ´ **Route Radius of Influence**

#### üîç **Determining Proximity**

- **Angular resolution**: The maximum angle between two objects before they appear as one blurred object.  
    - A human with 20/20 vision: ~1 arcminute.
    - This is:  `(1/60) * (1/60) * (œÄ / 180) = œÄ / 10,800 radians.`

- **Angular size formula**:  `Œ∏ = L / d`  
    where:
    - `L = 15 meters (Boeing 747 wingspan)`
    - `Œ∏ = œÄ / 10,800`

    Solving for `d`:  
    `d = L / Œ∏ = 15 / (œÄ / 10,800) ‚âà 51,566 meters.`

- **Horizontal displacement**:  
    Dividing by the average cruising altitude (9,144 meters):  
    `51,566 / 9,144 ‚âà 5.6 ‚âà 50 Km horizontal visibility.`

**Assumption**: Since haunted places likely don't have ideal viewing conditions, we conservatively reduced the radius of influence to ~10 Km.

### üö¶ **Flight High-Traffic Flag**

Flags areas with **high air traffic** density:

| **Possible Values** | **Criteria**                                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `True`              | More than 20 flights intersect the location.          |
| `False`             | 20 or fewer flights intersect the location.           |
