Below are the datasets joined  and source code used to produce the visualization. The final datasets used were **heavily cleaned and filtered** to reduce computational load. 

### **[Haunted Places](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/haunted-places)**

The haunted places dataset is a dataset of 10992 rich text descriptions of haunted places across the United States. Extra features were generated using **NLP** and **parsing** techniques.

### **[Routes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/routes.dat)** 

Routes are from the **OpenFlights** database. This database contains **67663 routes** between 3321 airports across 548 airlines. I used mathematical scripts to calculate the flight trajectories. 

### **[Airports.tsv](https://ourairports.com/data/)**
Airport locations are from the **OurAirports** dataset. This is an open source database of over **40,000 airports** across the globe. 

### **[Source Code](https://github.com/dgottschalk03/hauntedFlightsVisualization)**

Detailed source code including **raw datasets**, **flight functions**, and **feature addition** can be found on at this repo.

### **[Idea]**

This website was my final project for **DSCI550 - "Data Science at Scale"**. I took this course in SP25 at USC with [Dr_Chris_Mattmann](https://irds.usc.edu/faculty/mattmann/). Original repo for the assignment can be found here ðŸ‘‰ [dsci_550_a1](https://github.com/dgottschalk03/dsci_550_a1). 

>I'd also like to credit my group members: Reha Matai, Serafina Smith, Kate Mathews, and Mikena Moore. Details of their contributions can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/dgottschalk03/dsci_550_a1/blob/main/README.md) for that repo.
